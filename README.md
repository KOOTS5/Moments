# ⌛ Moments
A **minimalistic** and **easy-to-use** journal planner, built for Orbital 2021.

## Motivation
Have you always heard that penning down your thoughts helps you to feel more organised, do you have a planner as well to organise all your appointments? When you try to start habits to get your life on track, having to navigate between these applications start to feel more **cumbersome** and we drop the habit all together. 

Nowadays, there is such a huge variety of journaling apps to pick from with **tons of features**, that individuals may **not be useful** or **irrelevant**. There also seems to be a lack of a **minimalistic** app that integrates the two components, a **journal** and **calendar** nicely, without having to navigate through numerous pages or features that you don’t need. Thus, we aim to provide a solution to such an issue.
